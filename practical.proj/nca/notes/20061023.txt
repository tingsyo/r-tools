[Combine NCA with kNN]

1. k = 1 for kNN, because this is what we assumed when deriving the objective function for NCA.

2. package <b>class</b> is needed:
<pre>  $ library(class)</pre>

3. The code is very easy, just do transform before perform kNN:
<pre>
ncaknn <- function(train, test, cl, k = 1, ...)
{
    tm <- nca(train,cl)$par     # Transformation matrix trained through NCA
    TrTrain <- train %*% tm     # Transform the training data
    TrTest  <- test  %*% tm     # Transform the testing data
    knn(TrTrain, TrTest, cl, k,...)
}
</pre>
===> Test OK.

4. ToDo:
  - Test with some data set.
  - Add dimension reduction support.
  - Add option for initial guess: identity matrix, covariance matrix, or pooled covariance matrix.
