< Neighbourhood Component Analysis >
1. Sam Roweis' idea
  - Background
    - simple classifiers perform very well
    - kNN: a simple, non-parametric classifier.
           What is the definition of "nearest"?
    - leave-one-out(LOO) error is hard to optimize
    -> use distance metric that optimizes the LOO error

  - Math
    - Stochastic neighbour selection: 
    
  
2. ToDo: 
  - implement NCA in R
  - replicate Roweis' result (UCI-Wine data)
  - think about other way to define the distance metric
  
  
3. Note:
  - to optimize customized objective function: optim in {stat} package 
  - Ivanovs has worked with optim for a while, contact him if need some hints
