1. Test of UCI-wine data:
    exp(distance) goes to "Inf" -> can not compute
    
    -> normalize data with std.data()
    

2. Does not give converged results
    -> initial guess with identity matrix -> no
    -> initial guess with covariance matrix -> no

3. Bug fixed:
    -> "unclass(y)!=1" work only for binary class, not for UCI-wine
    -> still does not converge after the fix
